CODE OF CONDUCT: ACADEMIC EMPLOYEES:

 
VGC is mandated by law and by the community it serves to provide an 
educational environment that demonstrates professionalism and academic currency, values 
diversity, and respects the processes and traditions of learning. 
The terms of this mandate are prescribed by the founding documents of the College; by the 
laws to which the College is subject; by the collective agreements that govern academic 
employees and support staff; and by the operational policies and procedures that the College 
has adopted (see Appendix C). 
Central to these documents and the processes that created them is the 
implicit 
assumption of 
professionalism and appropriate professional conduct on the part of all College employees. 
This code of conduct is designed to provide an 
explicit 
definition of the minimal standards of 
professional conduct expected of all faculty. It represents, for the College, a benchmark of 
expectations about faculty conduct and defines the boundaries within which a rewarding and 
mutually supportive learning environment can be created. 
For the purposes of this document, the terms "academic employees" and "faculty" are used 
interchangeably to refer to full-time, partial-load, part-time, and sessional professors, instructors, 
counsellors, and librarians.
