1    CURRICULUM PATTERN
Students are responsible for ensuring that all academic requirements of the diploma, certificate, 
or applied degree program in which they are registered are met.
1.1   Prerequisite Courses
Certain courses are pre­requisites for others and therefore, must be completed in a specific 
sequence. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that all pre­requisites have been 
successfully completed in order to progress into the next semester. 
Continuing Education students should check with the Program Co­ordinator for policies 
pertaining to Continuing Education.
1.2   Co requisite Courses
Certain courses or practical experiences must be taken at the same time. If the student fails a 
co requisite course the student may be required to repeat both courses and/or practical 
experience.
1.3   Fast Track Program
Students have an opportunity to complete their programs faster when: 
­  they have been granted Advanced Standing in a program, or 
­  the program is offered through the summer semester.
1.4   Program Cancellation or Changes
George Brown College regularly surveys employment opportunities and revises and updates its 
programs accordingly. If at any time it becomes clear to the College that employment prospects 
for any program are limited, or for any other compelling reason related to a College offering, the 
College reserves the right to: 
­  replace, update, defer, limit or cancel such program/course offerings 
­  revise or replace certain semester courses or sections thereof.

2    DIPLOMA, CERTIFICATE, AND DEGREE PROGRAMS

A diploma, certificate, or degree program is a prescribed sequence of semester courses that 
meets the requirements for an Ontario College certificate, diploma, or degree. These programs 
are developed and offered under the authority of one of the divisions/faculties/ programs of the 
College. 
Under the provisions of this policy, a comprehensive listing of all diplomas, certificates, and 
degrees issued by George Brown College is maintained. Where diplomas, certificates, and 
applied degrees can be earned sequentially, such sequences will be identified as part of that 
listing under the authority of this policy. 
George Brown College grants Ontario certificates and diplomas, advanced diplomas and 
graduate certificates in accordance with the Qualifications Framework developed by the Ontario

2.1   Collaborative Programs
Degree level programs may be collaborative programs with other universities where the degree 
is granted by the university. Students must meet all the requirements as determined by the 
degree granting institution. In a collaborative program students may receive diplomas from the 
college as part of the degree level studies. Students must meet all the requirements for the 
diploma.
2.2   Degree Completion and Articulation
The College has agreements with other postsecondary institutions in which graduates with an 
Ontario College credential may get credit towards a degree at their institution. Consult the 
transfer guide for information.
2.3   George Brown College Degrees
Under the authority of the Post Secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act 2000, the 
college may also grant a degree. Consent for offering the degree is given by Ministry of 
Training, Colleges, and Universities upon the recommendation of the Post Secondary Education 
Quality Assessment Board (PEQAB). All degree programs granted under this act will undergo a 
recertification process carried out by PEQAB five years from the date of consent.

3    DIPLOMA, CERTIFICATE, AND DEGREE COURSES
Diploma, certificate, and degree courses are those in which the primary emphasis is on material 
related directly and practically to the field of work for which the student is preparing. Successful 
acquisition of appropriate skills and satisfactory performance in field placements are the 
required ingredients for success in certain courses. For these, a satisfactory level must be 
achieved in both theory and field placement before a passing grade may be granted.
3.1   Duplicate Use of Credit and Course Equivalency
Where George Brown course credits (whether earned directly, granted as equivalent, or 
obtained through Advanced Standing) have been used toward the granting of a certificate or 
diploma, these courses may be used toward the granting of subsequent certificates or diplomas 
when: 
­  such a sequence of certificates/diplomas is approved by the College, 
­  a specific course is common to both certificates or diplomas, or 
­  a specific course required in the subsequent program is deemed to be the equivalent of a 
course completed in the first program. 
Duplicate use of credits may be denied by the receiving College official(s) where competence in 
the relevant course(s) cannot be clearly demonstrated or documented. 
Applying diploma level courses to a degree program will be determined on a case­by­case basis 
by the Faculty or the Institution granting the degree.
